(This readme is not correct to the current state of the parser --- it describes intentions, particularly around
the example usage.)

redshift is a natural-language syntactic dependency parser that aims to stay up-to-the-minute with the latest
improved tricks and techniques, without compromising practicality and usability for non-experts.

If you don't know what a syntactic dependency is, read this:
http://googleresearch.blogspot.com.au/2013/05/syntactic-ngrams-over-time.html .

For NLP people: redshift is a transition-based parser using averaged perceptron that features all the
latest trimmings, implemented efficiently in Cython.

Example usage:

>>> redshift.load_parser(priority='accuracy', text_type='web', labels=True)
>>> tokens, deps = redshift.deps_from_string(u'Redshift requires no preprocessing!', standoff=False)
>>> print tokens
((u'Redshift', u'NOUN'), (u'requires', u'VERB'), (u'no', u'ADV'), (u'preprocessing', u'NOUN'))
>>> print deps
((1, 0, u'subj'), (1, 2, u'dobj'), (3, 2, u'nmod'))

Advantages:
- All-in-one processing. Most other parsers require you to chain together a tokenizer, sentence boundary detector,
  part-of-speech tagger, etc. Making those long pipelines work well on your data can take both time and nous.
- The fastest English config parses at over 1,000 sentences a second, with 91% accuracy.
- The most accurate English config gets 9X.XX% labelled accuracy (93.XX unlabelled), and still parses at XX
  sentences a second. The compromise model gets 9X.XX% at XX sentences per second.
- Specially tweaked model for web text
- Comes with models for many languages and types of text.

INSTALLATION

THE LAZIEST WAY

This will set-up a fully local install using virtualenv, with all the required dependencies. But, the script
does that by downloading everything -- XXmb in total.

git clone https://github.com/syllog1sm/redshift.git
cd redshift
./install_local_from_scratch.sh

WITHOUT DEPENDENCIES

These instructions just tell you how to set up the redshift package, and assume you'll set up the dependencies
separately. redshift's immediate dependencies:

- Python 2.7 (it'll probably be easy to make it work with Python 3)
- plac
- scipy
- Google sparsehash (a C++ library)
- Cython 0.17+
- fabric (not strictly required, but quite useful)

git clone https://github.com/syllog1sm/redshift.git
cd redshift
export PYTHONPATH=`pwd`:$PYTHONPATH
python setup.py build_ext --inplace
